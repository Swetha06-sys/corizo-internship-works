##Project Compilation
Overview
This README file covers two distinct projects:

A general interaction-based project focused on greeting exchanges and responses.
A specialized internship project centered around developing a machine learning classifier for semiconductor manufacturing yield prediction.
1. Greeting Interaction Project
This project involves creating an engaging and dynamic system that facilitates human-like greetings and responses. The system can be used in chatbots, virtual assistants, or customer service interfaces to enhance user experience.

2. Semiconductor Manufacturing Yield Classifier
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that predicts the pass/fail yield of a semiconductor manufacturing process based on sensor data. The model will assist in making informed decisions in the production environment.

How to Run the Projects
Greeting Interaction Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/greeting-interaction.git
cd greeting-interaction
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: Execute the script to start the interaction:

Copy code
python greet.py
Test the Responses: Engage with the system by sending different greetings and observing the responses.

Semiconductor Manufacturing Yield Classifier
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/semiconductor-yield-classifier.git
cd semiconductor-yield-classifier
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using:

Copy code
